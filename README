# Also Known As

A simple "launcher" of command-subcommand style where the the subcommands can
be altered based on configuration.

    $ aka alias pager more

    $ aka pager --version
    more from util-linux 2.36

    $ aka alias pager git

    $ aka pager --version
    git version 2.28.0

## Notes

Initial prototype uses aliases, which may not work for programs that depend on
establishing their behavior based on the `argv[0]` name they were called by
(busybox, for example).

We use an .aka file in the current directory for storing the aliases.

## Ideas

[ ] AKA_HOME environment variable to look for .aka (so we don't always look for
    .aka in either PWD or HOME)

[ ] `aka unalias` command

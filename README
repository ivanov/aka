# Also Known As

Simple, shell-based command aliasing

Usage: aka alias               show stored aliases
       aka alias NAME CMD...   store an alias for CMD
       aka NAME [...]          run CMD, optionally with more arguments

Examples:

    $ aka alias pager more

    $ aka pager --version
    more from util-linux 2.36

    $ aka alias pager git

    $ aka pager --version
    git version 2.28.0

Everything that is not aliased will get executed as usual.

## Notes

Initial prototype uses aliases, which may not work for programs that depend on
establishing their behavior based on the `argv[0]` name they were called by
(busybox, for example).

We use an .aka file in the current directory for storing the aliases.

## Ideas

[ ] AKA_HOME environment variable set to the directory containing the desired
    .aka file, otherwise we look for that file in the current directory.

[ ] `aka unalias` command
